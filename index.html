        <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work.
            That's
            why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.</p>

                didn't
                stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the
                deployment,
                server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to
                them.
                They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
